###### About 42

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
- Da Vinci
```
The school’s practical approach, based on peer-to-peer collaboration, guarantees both   
excellent technical training and the development of valuable soft skills, such as the ability to   
work in teams, problem-solving, adaptation, determination, and resilience.

###### An International School 

```
Founded in Paris in 2013, today 42 has more than 10.000  
students in over 20 countries, and is recognized as one of the  
best coding schools worldwide.  
```

###### Curriculum

```
The curriculum exposes a set of 17 skills, both soft and hard skills,  
instigating you to work on their talents – and weaknesses.  
Upon completion of each project you will earn experience points for these skills,  
allowing you to build experience towards a specific set of skills by selecting  
projects that you like.
The freedom of the curriculum gives everyone the opportunity to experience   
their unique journey towards building up their own skillset.  
Each student finishing the curriculum is therefore unique in comparison to each other.  
Plotting these skills on a graph for each student creates a digital print of their  
journey through the curriculum.

###### Note

```
All work is being developed under the strict guidelines of the school,  
and exclusive norm.  
The threshold to pass any project is 100%, 
We may attempt to validate as many times we want.  
Most of libc functions are ** forbidden ** thus our own implementation  
of basic funtionalities.  
```
